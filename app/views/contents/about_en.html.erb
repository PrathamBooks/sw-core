              <h3>Read</h3>
              <p>All learning depends upon the ability to read. When children have access to enjoyable and engaging stories in a language they are fluent in, they build their reading skills, which are essential for their growth and development. Stories introduce new words and ideas into a child's language – from picture books for the very young, to more complex narratives for older children. Stories help children learn about new concepts, new ideas and open up the windows of their imagination. Children who read often, become better readers, which leads to success in school and other areas of life. StoryWeaver is a platform that provides a free gateway to a never-ending collection of open source stories for children. Stories that tickle the imagination, inspire curiosity, and take children to places far and beyond. Stories that explore varied concepts in math, science, the environment, history, emotional intelligence and much more. Stories for the early readers and the more fluent ones in mother tongue languages from India and around the world.</p>
