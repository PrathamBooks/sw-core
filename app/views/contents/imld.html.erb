                                    <h3>About StoryWeaver Freedom to Read 2019</h3>
                                    <p>StoryWeaver believes that every child deserves to have reading material in her mother tongue. To this end, we aim to build 100 local language libraries - all digital, and would like to invite educators, translators, literacy organisations, and everyone else working with children to promote reading in their mother tongue to partner with us in this mission. Together, we will build 100 local language libraries by February 21, 2019 - International Mother Language Day.</p>

                                    <h3>Why Local Language Libraries?</h3>
                                    <p>UNESCO's report on mother tongue literacy states, 'children should be taught in a language they understand, yet as much as 40% of the global population does not have access to education in a language they speak or understand.'</p>
                                    <p>StoryWeaver is proud of the small but important role it is able to play in preserving languages for future generations and in helping create reading resources in languages that do not feature in mainstream publishing.</p>
                                    <p>The storybooks created on the platform are used in classrooms to retain students' interests and preserve the local culture and language. They also act as a much needed link between the language spoken at home and the medium of instruction in schools.</p>

                                    <p>Additionally, partners will also receive promotional support and be a part of StoryWeaver's Freedom to Read 2019 online activities. Selected partners will feature in our special report on leading organisations working to create mother tongue literacy resources for children. Most importantly, organisations and individuals collaborating with us will be part of a global movement to spread the joy of reading to more children in more languages.</p>
