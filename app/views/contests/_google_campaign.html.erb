      <label>About StoryWeaver</label>
      <p>StoryWeaver is a digital repository of openly licensed stories for children who have traditionally lacked access to books due to affordability and accessibility. With StoryWeaver, users can read, create or translate stories in the language of their choice for no cost. Today, StoryWeaver has over 4500 titles in 84 languages. Here are some of the ways that StoryWeaver is democratising access to books for children:</p>
